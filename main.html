    <p>we can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization to optimize a program</p>
    <ol>
      <li>we can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase</li>
		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time</li>
      <li> we can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algoriths</li>
